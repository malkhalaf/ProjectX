# First of all: you should have one of the following VM product in order to install the Saasbook VM img:
1- for windows users : - Virtual box (free)
2- for Mac OS X users: - Parallels (the one I got and it works pretty good for me)
		       - VmWare Fusion (Dr.Mouath's product)
:( both of them are not free.

3- download the Vm img from the following link: http://dekr0bcnl4w2b.cloudfront.net/saasbook-0.10.3.1.zip
4- when the download is completed, go to your VM product, file -> add an existing VM
5- In average, it will take around 5 mins to lunch Ubuntu login screen.
6- Finally, when you're asked to type the password, use the default password: saasbook (all small case)
7- Enjoy, :)
